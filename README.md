# Diffusion Tutorials and Examples

This project contains example code that demonstrates the use of [Diffusion](https://www.pushtechnology.com/product-overview) and the [Diffusion SDKs](https://docs.pushtechnology.com/#sdks).

Here you will find complete code examples on a variety of programming languages (starting with Javascript for now) to build applications in the following categories:

* [Real-Time Instant Messaging](https://github.com/pushtechnology/tutorials/tree/master/messaging) app demonstrating how to make a text chat app using publish-subscribe
* Real-time Data Store with Kafka
* Real-time Apps (Web, Mobile, IoT)
------------------
 All our examples include a README file describing the different features we will use from our SDK.
 
 Simply download our code examples or clone them to your local environment:
```
 git clone https://github.com/pushtechnology/tutorials/
```
 
 Please refer to the [online documentation](https://docs.pushtechnology.com/) for further details.
